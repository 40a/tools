Setting up a fresh build system
===============================

Install FreeBSD 10.0 amd64 release on a machine with at least
10GB of hard disk + 2GB of RAM, UFS works better than ZFS).
All other tasks require a root user.  Do the following to grab
the repositories:

    # pkg install git
    # cd /usr
    # git clone <username>@git.opnsense.org:repo/ports
    # git clone <username>@git.opnsense.org:repo/tools
    # git clone <username>@git.opnsense.org:repo/core
    # git clone <username>@git.opnsense.org:repo/src

Bootstrapping the build system
==============================

As root bootstrap an OPNsense GENERIC system (<cpus> is the
number of available threads + 1):

    # cd /usr/src
    # make -j<cpus> buildworld
    # make -j<cpus> buildkernel
    # make installkernel
    # make installworld
    # reboot

The object directory must be cleaned before continuing:

    # cd /usr/tools/build && ./clean.sh

These changes may need to be carried out again when src.git
changes.

Running the actual build
========================

The build is broken down into individual stages: base,
kernel and ports can be build separately and repeatedly
without affecting the others.  All stages can be reinvoked
and continue building without cleaning the previous progress.
A final stage assembles all three stages into a target image.

Go to the build directory:

    # cd /usr/tools/build

Build the userland binaries, bootloader and administrative
files:

    # ./base.sh

Build the kernel and loadable kernel modules:

    # ./kernel.sh

Build all the ports and wrap them into a single package:

    # ./ports

A bootable LiveCD image is created using:

    # ./iso

Some more random information
============================

* During the ports build you won't be able to operate git(1),
  but the ports build will eventually rebuild the port so
  everything will be back to normal when the ports build ends.

* For very fast ports rebuilding of already installed packages
  the following works:

    # pkg delete -fy <packagename>
    # cd /usr/tools/build && ./ports quick

* All packages are stored under /tmp/packages

* Kernel and base sets are stored under /tmp/sets

* All final images are stored under /tmp/images
